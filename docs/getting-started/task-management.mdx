# Task Management

As you use Cline, you'll accumulate many tasks over time. The task management system helps you organize, filter, search, and clean up your task history to keep your workspace efficient.

## Accessing Task History

You can access your task history by:

1. Clicking on the "History" button in the Cline sidebar
2. Using the command palette to search for "Cline: Show Task History"

## Task History Features

The task history view provides several powerful features:

### Searching and Filtering

-   **Search Bar**: Use the fuzzy search at the top to quickly find tasks by content
-   **Sort Options**: Sort tasks by:
    -   Newest (default)
    -   Oldest
    -   Most Expensive (highest API cost)
    -   Most Tokens (highest token usage)
    -   Most Relevant (when searching)
-   **Favorites Filter**: Toggle to show only favorited tasks

### Task Actions

Each task in the history view has several actions available:

-   **Open**: Click on a task to reopen it in the Cline chat
-   **Favorite**: Click the star icon to mark a task as a favorite
-   **Delete**: Remove individual tasks (favorites are protected from deletion)
-   **Export**: Export a task's conversation to markdown

## ‚≠ê Task Favorites

The favorites feature allows you to mark important tasks that you want to preserve and find quickly.

### How Favorites Work

-   **Marking Favorites**: Click the star icon next to any task to toggle its favorite status
-   **Protection**: Favorited tasks are protected from individual and bulk deletion operations (can be overridden)
-   **Filtering**: Use the favorites filter to quickly access your important tasks

## Batch Operations

The task history view supports several batch operations:

-   **Select Multiple**: Use the checkboxes to select multiple tasks
-   **Select All/None**: Quickly select or deselect all tasks
-   **Delete Selected**: Remove all selected tasks
-   **Delete All**: Remove all tasks from history (favorites are preserved unless you choose to include them)

## Multi-Task Handling

Cline now supports improved handling of multiple related tasks, allowing for more efficient work on complex projects.

### Key Features

-   **Task Relationships**: Cline can now track relationships between tasks, allowing for better context sharing
-   **Context Memory**: Important context from one task can be automatically shared with related tasks
-   **Step-by-Step Approach**: Complex tasks are broken down into smaller, more manageable steps
-   **File Context Tracking**: Relevant files are tracked across related tasks for better continuity

### How It Works

When working on a complex project, Cline will:

1. Break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable steps
2. Maintain context between related tasks
3. Share important file contexts and concepts between tasks
4. Provide a more coherent experience across multiple related tasks

## Best Practices

1. **Favorite Important Tasks**: Mark reference tasks or frequently accessed conversations as favorites
2. **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically remove old or unused tasks to improve performance
3. **Use Search**: Leverage the fuzzy search to quickly find specific conversations
4. **Export Valuable Tasks**: Export important tasks to markdown for external reference
